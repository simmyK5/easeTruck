# Mongoose Audit Plugin

Keeps a history of all changes of a document.

## Introduction

Open source Mongodb does not provide an audit service (You have it available in the enterprise version).

This mongoose plugin allows you to audit changes in the models. It provides two kind of audits:

* In the modified collection it adds the fields: _updateAt, _createdAt and _user (optional).
* It also register the activity in the  *auditlog* collection.

The fields of the auditlog documents are:

* ts: The timestamp
* operation: create, update or delete
* location: The affected collection
* document: The document before the operation
* user: The user (optional)

In case you wish to include the user in the audit, you must provide in the document at some point in your code.
You just need to make usage of the 'protected' attribute _user.

IMPORTANT!!! This plugin is able to audit operations that work with mongoose documents. Mongoose model operations aren't audited.
Example: Model.remove({...}) won't work. You need to do a remove in the located document after a Model.find({...}) operation.

## Installation

```bash
npm install mongoose-audit
```

Or add it to your package.json

## Usage

Just add the pluging to the schema you wish to audit:

```javascript
anSchema.plugin(require('moongose-audit'));
```

In Mongoose models are linked to a connection. In case you wish to use a connection different that the default one to
store the auditlog you need to provide it in the options argument of the plugin call.
Also if you are using more than one connection probably you wish to have one auditlog per connection. Example:

```javascript
anSchema.plugin(require('moongose-audit'), {connection: myConnection})
otherShema.plugin(require('moongose-audit'), {connection: otherConnection})
```
